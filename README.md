# sales_kpi_dashboard
Built a dynamic and interactive Sales KPI Dashboard using Streamlit, which visualizes key business metrics like Revenue, Orders, CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), and AOV (Average Order Value). The app integrates forecasting using Linear Regression and enables natural language querying of the dataset using LangChain + Groq's LLama3 model.
